   <p><b>We use Artificial Intelligence in some applications</b></p>
     <ol>
      <li><b>Artificial Intelligence in business:</b></li>
      Robotic process automation is being applied to highly repetitive tasks normally performed by humans. 
      Machine learning algorithms are being integrated into analytics and CRM (Customer relationship management)
       platforms to uncover information on how to better serve customers. Chatbots have already been incorporated 
       into websites and e companies to provide immediate service to customers. Automation of job positions has also
        become a talking point among academics and IT consultancies.
      <li><b>Artficial Intelligence in education:</b></li>
      It automates grading, giving educators more time. It can also assess students and adapt to their needs,
       helping them work at their own pace.
      <li><b>Artificial Intelligence in Autonomous vehicles: </b></li>
      Just like humans, self-driving cars need to have sensors to understand the world around them and a brain to collect,
       processes and choose specific actions based on information gathered. Autonomous vehicles are with advanced tool to gather information, 
       including long range radar, cameras, and LIDAR. Each of the technologies are used in different capacities and each collects different information.
        This information is useless, unless it is processed and some form of information is taken based on the gathered information.
         This is where artificial intelligence comes into play and can be compared to human brain. 
      <li><b>Artificial Intelligence for robotics</b></li>
      will allow us to address the challenges in taking care of an aging population and allow much longer independence. It will drastically reduce, 
      may be even bring down traffic accidents and deaths, as well as enable disaster response for dangerous situations for example the nuclear meltdown at the fukushima power plant.
      <li><b>Cyborg Technology:</b></li>
      One of the main limitations of being human is simply our own bodies and brains. Researcher Shimon Whiteson thinksthat in the future, we will be able to augment ourselves with
       computers and enhance many of our own natural abilities. Though many of these possible cyborg enhancements would be added for convenience, others may  serve a more practical purpose. 
       Yoky Matsuka of Nest believes that AI will become useful for people with amputated limbs, as the brain will be able to communicate with a robotic limb to give the patient more control. This kind of cyborg technology would significantly
        reduce the limitations that amputees deal with daily.
     </ol>
     <p>In the future, predictive analytics and artificial intelligence could play an even more fundamental role in content creation and also in the software fields. 
       Open source information and artificial intelligence collection will provide opportunities for global technological parity and the technology of artificial can become
        the future in all the domains of health, environment, public safety and security.</p>
