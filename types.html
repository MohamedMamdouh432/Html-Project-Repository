      <ol>
              <li><b>Reactive Machines</b></li>
               They are the most basic and oldest type of Artificial Intelligence. 
              They replicate a human’s ability to react to different kinds of stimuli. 
              This type of AI has no memory power so they lack the capability to use previously 
              gained information/experience to obtain better results Therefore these kinds of AI
               don’t have the ability to train themselves like the ones we come across nowadays.
              <li><b>Limited Memory</b></li>
               These type of AI, along with the ability of Reactive Machines, have memory capabilities
               so they can use past information/experience to make better future decisions. Most of the common
                applications existing around us fall under this category. These AI applications can be trained 
                by a large volume of training data which they store in their memory in the form of a reference model.
              <li><b>Theory of Mind</b></li>
               Theory of Mind is the next level of AI, which has very limited to no presence in our day to day lives. 
              These kind of AI are mostly in the “Work in Progress” stage and are usually confined to research labs. 
              These kinds of AI once developed will have a very deep understating of human minds ranging from their needs,
               likes, emotions, thought process, etc. Basis their understanding of Human minds and their whims the AI will be
                able to alter its own response. 
              <li><b>Self-awarenes</b></li>
              This is the final stage of AI. Its current existence is only hypothetical and can be found only in Science fiction movies.
               These kinds of AI can not only understand and evoke human emotions but can also have emotions of its own. These kind of AI are 
               decades if not centuries away from materializing. It is this kind of AI which AI skeptics like Elon Musk are wary of. 
               This is because once it is self-aware, the AI can get into Self-Preservation mode it might consider humanity as a 
               potential threat and may directly or indirectly pursue endeavor to end humanity.

       <h4>type 2 : Based on capabilities </h4>
       <img src="https://cdn.educba.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Types-of-Artificial-Intelligence-3.png">
       <ol>
       <li><b>Narrow AI</b></li>
         Narrow AI is a term used to describe artificial intelligence systems 
        that are specified to handle a singular or limited task. The antithesis to Narrow AI,
         sometimes referred to as weak AI, is called strong AI. Strong AI, unlike Narrow AI, 
         is capable of handling a wide range of tasks rather than one particular task or problem.
          This variation of artificial intelligence can be roughly conceptualized as a foundation 
          for neural networks emulating sentience or consciousness.
        <li><b>General AI</b></li>
        General AI is the hypothetical[1] intelligence of a machine that has the capacity to understand or 
        learn any intellectual task that a human being can. It is a primary goal of some artificial 
        intelligence research and a common topic in science fiction and futures studies. AGI can also 
        be referred to as strong AI,[2][3][4] full AI,[5] or general intelligent action.[6] Some academic 
        sources reserve the term "strong AI" for machines that can experience consciousness.[7] Today's AI
         is speculated to be decades away from AGI.
        <li><b>Strong AI</b></li>
        Strong Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a theoretical form of machine intelligence that is equal to human intelligence.
         Key characteristics of Strong AI include the ability to reason, solve puzzles, make judgments, plan, learn, and communicate.
          It should also have consciousness, objective thoughts, self-awareness, sentience, and sapience.
