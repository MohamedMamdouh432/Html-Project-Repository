   <h3> Artificial Intelligence (AI) </h3>
   <p>the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks
      commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the 
      project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic 
      of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from 
      past experience. Since the development of the digital computer in the 1940s, it has been 
      demonstrated that computers can be programmed to carry out very complex tasks—as, for example, 
      discovering proofs for mathematical theorems or playing chess—with great proficiency. </p>

   <p>There are a number of different forms of learning as applied to artificial intelligence.
      The simplest is learning by trial and error. For example, a simple computer program for
       solving mate-in-one chess problems might try moves at random until mate is found. 
       The program might then store the solution with the position so that the next time the computer
        encountered the same position it would recall the solution. This simple memorizing of individual
         items and procedures—known as rote learning—is relatively easy to implement on a computer.
          More challenging is the problem of implementing what is called generalization. 
          Generalization involves applying past experience to analogous new situations.</p>

   <h4>History of Artificial Intelligence</h4>
    <p>The term artificial intelligence was first coined by John McCarthy in 1956 when he held the first academic
       conference on the subject. But the journey to understand if machines can truly think began much before that. In
       Vannevar Bush’s seminal work As We May Think [Bush45] he proposed a system which amplifies people’s own
       knowledge and understanding. Five years later Alan Turing wrote a paper on the notion of machines being able to
       simulate human beings and the ability to do intelligent things, such as play Chess [Turing50].</p>
    <p>No one can refute a computer’s ability to process logic. But to many it is unknown if a machine can think. The
       precise definition of think is important because there has been some strong opposition as to whether or not this
       notion is even possible. For example, there is the so-called ‘Chinese room’ argument [Searle80]. Imagine someone
       is locked in a room, where they were passed notes in Chinese. Using an entire library of rules and look-up tables
       they would be able to produce valid responses in Chinese, but would they really ‘understand’ the language? The
       argument is that since computers would always be applying rote fact lookup they could never ‘understand’ a
       subject.</p>
